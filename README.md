# Indoor Basketball Scoreboard

This repository holds the development of a simple scoreboard, designed for a child's indoor basketball hoop.  The key attributes (as prompted by grandchild!) are:
- Large 8-segment display digits (57mm)
- Countdown clock (2 digit)
- Hoop counter (2 digit) displaying successful shots within countdown period
- Audible buzzer with separate tones sounding:  precount; hoops counted;  end of shooting period
- External pushbutton to initiate countdown and shooting period
